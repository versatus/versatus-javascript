### Overview
This repository provides some essential tools and interfaces for developing
**Programs** for the **LASR** network using Typescript.
It provides a number of helpful types, classes,
examples, and functions to aid in the building of LASR programs.
Along with some helper functions The CLI is used to
initialize, build, deploy, and call programs in the network from the terminal.

**LASR** stands for a Language Agnostic Stateless Rollup. The protocol
enables developers with the ability to write Programs that run on the network
in some of today's most popular programing languages.

We currently support:
* Typescript ✅
* Javascript ⏳
* Python ⏳
* Rust ⏳
* Golang ⏳
* C ⏳
* C++ ⏳

But that list isn't prescriptive. We're a small and mighty team that welcomes
anyone who wants to create an SDK for LASR in any language.
